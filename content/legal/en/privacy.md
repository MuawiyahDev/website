## Hosting

Our hoster collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request came, and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DSGVO.

There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.

We use the following hoster for the provision of our website:

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO, not to have to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. The server is located in the USA.
